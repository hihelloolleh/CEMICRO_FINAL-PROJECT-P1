1. Initialize address counter (ADDR = 0)
2. Main write loop begins
3. Output address to EPROM
4. save registers (PSHA, PSHB) *
5. Load data pattern count (for sanity check??????)
6. exit with failure if di nagwwrite (idk how to explain)
  - like just print whatever nakuha na write value then end
7. configure portc and output for data bus
8. apply small delay to give hc11 to apply DDRC

want to implement:
- display 25 bytes for read (to make sure that eprom is reading... sanity check b)
- another 25 bytes to display for writing (tho im not sure coz this might be byte 26 or so or idk ;;)
